Coding ideas.

Each device should have an example program to diminstrate how it is access.

The programe should be named after the functions they preform, IE 
'pressure' for the air pressue device.  Note the device may have other
functions as well, IE temp to regulate the pressure reading that may also
be readable. In that case command line options can/should be allowed to
print these results as well.  

The program should not produce a banner. It should print a USAGE if a command
line option is needed or wrong.

Raw data shold be the default results.  Command line options can be used
to convert the raw value into other values IE entigrade to fahrenheit. 

Other calculated values like dow point can also be provided with command
line options.
