Coding ideas.

Each device should have an example program to diminstrate how it is accessed.

Because there are many defices for the same function, tempature for example,
the program should be named after the devide not the function. This is very
true of devices that do more then one function.

Note the device may have other functions as well, IE temp to regulate the 
pressure reading that may also be readable. In that case command line options 
can/should be allowed to print these results as well.  

The program should not produce a banner. It should print a USAGE statment if 
a command line option is needed or wrong. (-h)

Raw data shold be the default results.  Command line options can be used
to convert the raw value into other values IE entigrade to fahrenheit. 

Other calculated values like dow point can also be provided with command
line options.
